# C Rush – End-of-Year Engineering Project

## Project Overview

This 2-week project was designed to simulate a professional software development "crunch" period, similar to what might occur in a company. The goal was to deliver a complete and functional product that integrated various technical and algorithmic components, such as graph traversal, maze generation, and transformations in the complex plane.

The project was carried out in a team of three: **Eva Thieulin**, **Thibault Mure**, and myself. It was divided into two phases:

1. **Exploration Phase (Week 1):**  
   Focused on discovering and experimenting with key tools and algorithms through small individual and collaborative exercises.

2. **Production Phase (Week 2):**  
   Dedicated to developing a full video game using the **SDL2** graphics library, based on the knowledge acquired during the first week.

Each phase concluded with a 15-minute oral presentation.

## Project Evaluation

We were assessed on several criteria, including:
- Technical implementation
- Team collaboration and project management
- Oral communication skills
- Use of Git
- Overall quality of the final product

We received the **highest distinction: "Très Bien – Félicitations du jury"**.

⚠️ _Note: Our original Git usage was done on an internal school Git server. This repository is a reconstructed version of the project without the full commit history._

## Organizational Notes

To ensure efficient progress, we implemented a few simple but effective strategies:
- **Daily team meetings** each morning to define objectives, assign tasks, and review current progress.
- A **shared project logbook** was used to document brainstorming sessions, algorithm ideas, drafts, and technical notes. This helped us track decisions and revisit important concepts more easily.

## Phase 1 – Learning and Prototyping

### Individual Work
- **SDL Basics:** A simple program to experiment with window creation and manipulation.
- **Snake Clone:** An SDL-based game to study keyboard controls and interactive rendering.
- **Flappy Bird-like Game:** Focused on texture management, user interaction, and proper separation of game logic and graphics.

### Group Work
- **Maze Generation Algorithms:** Implementation and comparison of multiple maze generation techniques.
- **Graph Traversal Algorithms:** Used for navigation and game logic.
- **Complex Plane Transformations:** A mini-library of visual effects based on continuous transformations.

## Phase 2 – Final Game: Mativa's Adventures

The second week focused on developing our main game: a **maze escape game** in which the player controls a character trying to find the exit.

The game was built entirely in **C** using **SDL2**, and integrates key concepts learned during the first week.  
You can find more details about the gameplay and objectives in the `rules.txt` file included in the repository.

## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to my teammates **Eva Thieulin** and **Thibault Mure**, with whom I improved my teamwork and organizational methods.  
We also extend our gratitude to **Mr. Daniel** and the entire teaching team for proposing this project, guiding us with insightful advice, and helping us discover new aspects of project management and computer science in general.
